# Character fixtures

`fp_arch_mage.json` is the one committed character: a format-3 Arch Mage (F/P, job 212) at the start of a round, with
tier 2 unlocked and the tier-1 equipment kit worn: a reqLevel-25 staff (1382002), a reqLevel-30 hat (1002013), reqLevel-20
shoes (1072019), reqLevel-15 gloves (1082019) and the starter top and bottom. The items are unscrolled, with canonical
base stats and no survivor overrides. A format-3 character keeps only its job, look, equipment, scrolls, mesos, cash, pet
and `tiers_unlocked` (ADR 0006), so there is no level, skill list or AP to carry; every round starts at Lv1. It is the
character for Sleepywood checks (`--stage=sleepywood --character=<this file>`), paired with a fresh character (the starter
wand only) to show what gear is worth, and the base of the `--hub` test kit.

`tools/character_fixture.gd --kit=1382002,1002013,1072019,1082019,1040002,1060002 --tiers=2` reproduces it exactly (its
`_doc` records the ids, the revision and the label). The tool's other modes write the character a real bot round leaves
behind (its pickups, the tier its clear unlocks) and convert older files. Tool files of format 1 or 2 still load
(`CharacterSnapshot.migrate` keeps the format-3 part). The fixtures of the unported job lines and of the second jobs were
deleted with job advancement (#284, #286, #294).
